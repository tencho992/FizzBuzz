# My Classic FizzBuzz

This was a classic practice with results displayed in our console.log  
Give it a shot!

6. issue pull request with any feedback

  * Challenge:
  Console log number 1-100

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 

I am eager to learn everything JavaScript and hope to one day come close to mastering this language. 

Starting with more focused and smaller projects allowed me to embrace versatile functions and all its capabilities. In doing so, I was also able to strength my CSS skills while diving deep into focus mode on very basic fundamental functions.

## Lessons Learned:

Conditionals have always been a favorite of mine from the beggining. I feel comfortable using conditionals and enjoy utilizing ternary statements for that <em> wow i wrote that? </em> moment.

I also learned that although JS has hoists for functions, the main way program language is read is from top to bottom. This applies within a scope as well. 
The conditionals for each Fizz and Buzz worked but I struggled in displaying FizzBuzz on my console.log because I was not thinking about the way the computer will read within my function scope. Which is as always: top to bottom. It wasn't until it put the AND && conditional of FizzBuzz on the top of my list of conditionals, was the console able to read and return the desired output. 

*fuck yesss!*
